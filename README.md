# Multichain Token Contracts

This repository contains smart contracts for implementing multichain token deployments using two different models: Hub and Spoke, and Burn and Mint.

## Contracts

### HubToken

`HubToken` is designed for the Hub and Spoke model. It represents the central token on the hub chain where the total supply is maintained.

### PeerToken

`PeerToken` is a flexible contract that can be deployed as either a spoke token in the Hub and Spoke model or as a token in the Burn and Mint model.

## Usage

### Hub and Spoke Model

1. Deploy `HubToken` on the main chain (Hub chain).
2. Deploy `PeerToken` on each spoke chain.
3. Configure the minter address in each `PeerToken` to control minting permissions.

### Burn and Mint Model

1. Deploy `PeerToken` contracts on all participating chains.
2. Configure the minter address in each `PeerToken` to control minting permissions.

## Deployment

To deploy these contracts, you can use Forge. Here's an example of how to deploy the PeerToken contract using forge:

[Install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

```bash
forge create --rpc-url <SEPOLIA_RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/PeerToken.sol:PeerToken --constructor-args "TestBurnToken" "TBT" <MINTER_ADDRESS> <OWNER_ADDRESS>
```
